# 04- Final Project: ShortestPath
This project will create a program which will ask the user to enter two states in USA and it will find the shortest path to get there. The idea of doing this project is by creating a graph of cities in the Unites States with link to the other cities. Each city wil be used as a vertex in the graph and each link between cities will be an edge in the graph. The cities with their corresponding parameters will be read from a CSV data file.


# Project Overview
This project is a good choice in getting familiar how the google map, maps or other programs make it possible to find the fastest way to get to the required destination. Also more practice using JAVA. The output of this project should be something like: It will ask the user to put the name of a city, which will be the starting point, and then it will ask the name of second city which will be the destination.
